# Movie App
* The Movie App is a web application that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and manage their favorite movies. Users can log in using their Google account or sign up with an email and password. The app uses the Firebase platform for authentication and data storage. The application uses The Movie Database API to fetch movie data and Firebase Firestore to store the user's favorite movies.

# Usage


## User Authentication
Movie App uses Firebase Authentication for managing user accounts. The app supports both Google account login and email/password login. If the user does not have an account they may also sign up. The user is able to sign in to view contents of the application & also sign out when done. Each user has a validation token generated once signed up and used again to validate every time they log back in.
